SETTING UP


1. Plugged the BeagleBone into my MacBook via USB.

2. Opened the BeagleBone device on my desktop.

3. Opened "START.htm", and followed the instructions.

4. Installed both drivers for Mac OS X and restarted my computer. The change was reflected in 
"START.htm" with step 2 highlighted green.

5. Opened terminal


<sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2>
	I typed in my computer's password, then the BeagleBone's password to SSH into my BeagleBone. 

<sudo connmanctl>
<enable wifi>
<scan wifi>
<services>
<agent on>
<connect wifi_2cf7f106667e_47656e6520426c6f636b_managed_psk>

	This was the wifi from the hotspot from my phone. I typed the password and a connection was 
established.

<quit>

REMOTE HOST SIDE


	My partner ran <ifconfig> to find his IP address, which was "172.20.10.5".


<ssh-keygen>
	This generated a pair of public and private keys. I left the file to save the key in as the 
default, and generated the passphrase "beaglebone2". 


<ssh-copy-id -i justin@172.20.10.5>
	This SSH's to the server under the remote host my partner created named "justin". I logged in 
with the password he created, "beaglebone1".


<ssh -X justin@172.20.10.5>
	I tried logging in again with X11 session forwarding. Again, I typed the password, 
"beaglebone1", which successfully logs me in.


<ls>
	It outputted no results. To see if I was actually a remote host, I used the touch command to 
create a file.


<touch beagle.txt>
<ls>
	Now I saw beagle.txt show up, meaning the file was created.


<exit>
