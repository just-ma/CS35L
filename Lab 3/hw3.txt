==========================================
1. 
	'case long_iso_time_style:' is within a switch 
statement twice. It is removed because it is redundant. The 
first case of 'case long_iso_time_style:' is blank, so if 
it encounters the case, the switch statement will jump to 
the next case which is also 'case long_iso_time_style:'.
	Removing it will have no effect in the end.


==========================================
2.

	The patched version replaces numbered dates, which 
are universal, with English words, which only English-
speakers can understand. This causes a problem if some 
employees are international and cannot read the new format.


==========================================
3.

	The file /dev/null is blank with no lines. This 
passes all the conditions in randline.py since it only 
checks if the number of lines is negative (if numlines < 
0:). It would run chooseline() which returns 
random.choice(self.lines). However, this would produce an 
index error since it expects lines but there are none, so 
index is out of range.


==========================================
4.
	Python 3 removed automatic tuple unpacking which is 
assigning values automatically to tuples within parameters 
of a function. This means function parameters that include 
2 or more objects will no longer be valid in Python 3.
	This causes trouble for a line near the end:
	except IOError as (errno, strerror):

	This tuple as a parameter becomes invalid in Python 
3 producing a syntax error.
